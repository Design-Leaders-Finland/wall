## Getting Started

### Install Dart and Flutter

[Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) (includes Dart):
   - Follow the instructions for your operating system.
   - After installation, run `flutter doctor` in your terminal to check for any missing dependencies.

### Local Development with Hot Reload

To start the app locally with hot reload:

```sh
flutter run
```

This will launch the app on your connected device or emulator. Save your changes to see them reflected instantly with hot reload.

## Quality Assurance

### Linting and Formatting

To check code quality and formatting, run:

```sh
flutter analyze
flutter format .
```

### Running Tests

To run all tests:

```sh
flutter test
```

Ensure all tests pass and address any issues reported by the analyzer before submitting changes.

## Documentation

### API Documentation

The project automatically generates comprehensive API documentation from code comments. The documentation is built and deployed to GitHub Pages as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

ðŸ“š **[View API Documentation](https://design-leaders-finland.github.io/wall/api-docs/)**

### Generating Documentation Locally

To generate the API documentation locally:

```sh
dart doc
```

This creates a `docs/` directory with the generated HTML documentation that you can open in your browser.

### Contributing to Documentation

When adding new classes, methods, or significant functionality:

1. Add comprehensive documentation comments using `///`
2. Include usage examples in code blocks
3. Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
4. Follow the [Dart documentation guidelines](https://dart.dev/effective-dart/documentation)

Example documentation format:
```dart
/// Brief description of the class or method.
/// 
/// More detailed explanation if needed. Can include multiple
/// paragraphs and markdown formatting.
/// 
/// ## Usage Example
/// ```dart
/// final service = MyService();
/// final result = await service.doSomething('parameter');
/// ```
/// 
/// **Parameters:**
